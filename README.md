# swl::variant

A minimal compile-time overhead, C++20 implementation of std::variant. Fully standard conforming with a couple of documented differences. 

## Compile-time performance

Because std::variant is implemented in both GCC and Clang libraries using a simple recursive union, accessing each members result in approximately N^2 functions template instantiations for a variant of size N. This implementation instead use a "binary-tree of unions", resulting in N.log2(N) instantiations, which results in drastically faster compile times (see measurements below). 

## Run-time performance

`std::variant` visit method is usually implemented using a table of functions pointers. Unfortunately, compilers cannot (yet?) "see through" those, and the generated code tends to be much larger and slower than a switch-case equivalent [more on this here](https://mpark.github.io/programming/2019/01/22/variant-visitation-v2/). Similarly to [Michael Park's implementation](https://github.com/mpark/variant), this implementation use a big, recursive switch for visitation. 

## Testing

The tests come from the LLVM libc++ repo. You don't need to use LLVM-lit, though : just compile ./test/all_tests.cpp as follow : 
`clang++ -std=c++20 ./test/all_test.cpp`
To run it, pass a string containing a prefix of the command necessary to compile a C++20 file, with the root directory and the ./test directory in the include paths. 
For example : 
`./a.out clang++ -std=c++20 -I . -I ..`

## Implementation divergence

* Specialization of std::hash is opt-in : specializing std::hash requires including \<functional\>, which is enormous

* `index()` doesn't return a `std::size_t`, but an integer whose size depends on the numbers of type inside the variant. Basically either `unsigned char` or `unsigned short`. 

* Clang implementation (but not GCC) forbids any kind of conversion to bool, not swl::variant

* Extension : if you like to live dangerously, `swl::unsafe_get` behave just like get, but without any errors checking. 

To activate hashing, use the following code before #include'ing : 
`#define SWL_VARIANT_USE_STD_HASH`

## Measurements 

The measurements are of the form (compile time, executable file size). 

All of these measurements were done without optimizations. 

The compilers used were Clang 12 and GCC 10. 

Single visitation : 
| Variant size | swl (clang) | std (clang) | swl (gcc) | std (gcc) 
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 20 | 1s, 50 Ko         | 1.4s  | 1.4s | 1.7s |
| 40 | 1.2s, 120 Ko      | 2.2s  | 1.8s | 3.2s |
| 80 | 1.4s, 300 Ko      | 5.2s  | 2.6s | 9.2s |
| 160 | 1.8s, 700 Ko     | 16.6s | 4.5s | 33.4s|
| 320 | 3s, 1.7 Mo       | 63s   | 8.4s | 143s |
| 640 | 5s, 4 Mo         | 315s  | 20s  | âˆž    |

Multi visitation of some variants of size 10 : 

| Numbers of variants | swl (clang) | std (clang) | swl (gcc) | std (gcc) 
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 2 | 1.1s, 49 Ko   | 1.6s, 128 Ko   | 2.8s, 41 Ko    | 1.3s, 160 Ko  |
| 3 | 2s, 142 Ko    | 8s, 1.1 Mo     | 3.8s, 123 Ko   | 9s, 1.5 Mo    |
| 4 | 6.7s, 630 Ko  | 68s, 11 Mo     | 10.5s, 560 Ko  | 95s, 17 Mo    |
